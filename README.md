# This is my Stream One assessment Project

The brief was fairly straightforward for this one and leant itself perfectly to a personal project of my own with real-world implications

My wife rins a small Candy Cart that she hires out for weddings and other events and showcasing this was going to be very similar to the 
example of a band as laid out in the brief

I have opted for a bootstrap approach as this saves time and everything works well together so all I need to worry about is the 
layout and design elements and making things look neat and tidy. And also working out the code for the booking form!

Will add more to this as I complete additional sections ofg the site.
